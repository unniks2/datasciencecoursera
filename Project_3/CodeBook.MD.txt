There are 180 observations for 81 variables in the final dataset.
1.  Subject
Describes the number allotted to a unique person from whom the data is collected. There are 30 unique numbers each representing a person.
Type: Character
2.  Activity
Describes the activity each person was engaged in while the measurements were recorded. There were 6 different activities.
WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING 
Type: Character
3. Average of Variables
 All the other variables are the average of different observations which were given in the original problem set.  Note only the standard deviation and mean of these variables were extracted (after which their average was calculated).
